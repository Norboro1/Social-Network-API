  ## Description
  This is a node app containing strictly backend code for an API. It uses the express and mongoose npm packages to communicate with a Mongo Database, allowing users to query and update User information, as well as information on their "thoughts" and "reactions" to said thoughts. This app serves mainly to test and display my proficiency in using the mongoose package to communicate with a DB, and the express package to route and serve data.

  ## Installation
  Simply clone this repository and run an "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies. 

  ## Usage
  Since this project is strictly backend code, you will need to use a program like insomnia to use and test the routes. Be sure to update the config/connection.js file if necessary with the URI for your own MongoDB before starting the server with the "node index.js" command. See my demo video for better clarity on how to use the routes: [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/FA9CiN7MEspnvXNAUFJG]
